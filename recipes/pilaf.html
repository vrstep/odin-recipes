    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rice Pilaf is an easy side dish that goes with pretty much anything and a great way to make a side of rice that’s not plain or lacking flavor. My recipe is flavored with onion and garlic and simmered in chicken broth until tender and fluffy.</p>
    <p>One of the best things about rice pilaf is how easy it is to customize. You can serve it as written in this recipe, or you can add a bunch of different flavors using herbs and spices to complement whatever main dish you’re serving.</p>
